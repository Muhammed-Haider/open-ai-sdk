OpenAI Agents Practice

Overview

This repository contains my practice projects using OpenAI agents to explore AI-powered automation and decision-making. It includes implementations of OpenAI's API for various agent-based tasks, experimentation with LLM-powered automation, and hands-on prompt engineering and fine-tuning.

Setup

Create a virtual environment using uv venv.

Install dependencies with uv pip install --requirements pyproject.toml.

Set your API key using:

Windows (PowerShell): $env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key"

Mac/Linux: export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key"

Run the agent with python agent.py.
